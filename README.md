# SkyShield 🚀  
### AI‑Enhanced Cloud Threat Detection & Mitigation System

SkyShield is an AI-powered cloud security application that detects suspicious and anomalous activities from cloud logs in real time. It uses machine learning models to identify potential threats and automatically trigger mitigation actions, while providing clear visibility through a dashboard.

---

##  Features
- AI-based anomaly detection using Machine Learning
- Real-time analysis of cloud activity logs
- Automatic threat detection and response (simulated)
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring threats
- Reduced false positives compared to rule-based systems
- Scalable design for future cloud integration

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Machine Learning:** Isolation Forest / Random Forest  
- **Backend Framework:** Flask or FastAPI  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **Frontend / Dashboard:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript / Streamlit  
- **Data Source:** Simulated Cloud Logs (AWS/Azure-like logs)  
- **Visualization & Alerts:** Charts, logs view, alert notifications  


---

##  Dataset
This project uses publicly available or simulated datasets such as:
- CICIDS2017
- UNSW-NB15
- AWS CloudTrail sample logs  

Datasets are used to simulate real-world cloud attack scenarios without requiring real cloud infrastructure.

---
##  Future Enhancements
-Integration with real cloud platforms (AWS / Azure)

-Advanced deep learning models (Autoencoders, LSTM)

Real-time email/SMS alerts

Role-based access control

Compliance and audit reports
